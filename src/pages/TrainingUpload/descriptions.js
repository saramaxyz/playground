        description: "Nose targeting, often called “Touch,” is all about having your dog touch a target with the tip of their nose. And where your dog’s nose goes, their head and body follow. That makes touch incredibly useful for training everything from obedience behaviors to tricks. It can even help redirect an anxious or reactive dog.",

    down:{
        description: "A reliable drop or down position is more stable than a sit. In a sit position, dogs can easily “spring up” into a stand while physiologically most dogs they are slower to get up into a stand from a drop. Further, in a sit, dogs are typically more alert and ready to move than when they are in a drop.",

            "Take the lure from your puppy’s nose to the ground then pull the lure under your legs. Your pup will have to lie down to get to the treat.",

    sit:{
        description:"One of the most important behaviors you can teach your dog is sit. Sitting has many uses; it can replace unwanted behavior and can keep your dog politely at your side. Sitting can also become your dog’s way to say “please” for things he wants. Teaching your dog to sit helps to increase the calm, controlled behavior many pet parents want while decreasing the out-of-control, hyper behavior that many dogs display.",

            "Stand in front of your puppy holding some of his dog food or treats.",
            "Wait for him to sit – say “yes” and give him a treat.",

        description:"You’ve probably taught your dog to sit and lie down and to stay in those positions until released. But there’s another body position you may have overlooked in your training: stand. Although you won’t use it as often as sit or down, teaching your dog to stand on cue is more useful than you might think and it’s easy to teach with lure and reward training or capturing the behavior.",

            "Place your dog in a sit.",

        description:"Learning to come when called, or recall to you, is one of the most important skills your dog can learn. But teaching a recall can be challenging, as dogs find so much of the world so interesting. Each time we ask our dog to come to us, we’re asking them to stop what they’re doing. That means turning away from other interesting smells, dogs, and food, to come to us. As a result, to build a reliable recall, we must teach our dogs that being near us is the most fun thing they can do, not to mention, the thing that brings them the most rewards.",
